1) Let Xi be the production rate of Product1,2,3
   X1 = Production rate of Product 1 
   X2 = Production rate of Product 2
   X3 = Production rate of Product 3 
   
Let us define auxillary variables as:

   y1+ and y1- represents the amount over and amount under the employment level goalrepectivel.
   y2+ and y2  represents the amount over and amounr under the earnings goal over next year respectively.
   
2) Express management's objective function in terms of x1, x2, x3, y1+,y1- , y2+ and y2-

Maximize Z: P -6C - 3D
          z   =  20x1 + 15 x2 + 25 x3 -6y1 + - 6y2+  - 3y2- S.T)
          
Employment Level:
        6x1 + 4x2 + 5x3 - (y1+ - y2-) = 50
        
Earning Level:
         8x1 + 7x2 + 5x3 - (y2+ -y2-) = 75
         
         
Non Negatively constraints:
       xi >= 0 ; i = 1,2,3
       yi +> 0  ;i = 1,2
       yi -> 0;  i = 1,2 
       
Prioritizing the goal using streamlined aprroach 
workforce and earning are high priority then the toatl profit over the life
(1) The different peanalty weights are assigned with each of the two priority level
(2)The individual penalty weights for the first -priority goals have been multiplied by M
These penalty weights yield the following single linear programming model that iincorporates all the goals
3)Preemptive Goal Programming Formulation:

Let Xi be the production  rate of Product 1,2,3

X1 = Production rate of Product1
X2 = Production rate of Product2
X3 = Production rate of Product3

Let us define auxillary variable as:

y1+ and y1-, represents the amount over and amount under the emplyment level goal respectively.
y2+ and y2, represents the amount over and amount under the earning goal over next year respectively.

Employment Level:

        6x1 + 4x2 + 5x3 -(y2+ - y2-) = 50
        
Earnings Level:

        8x1  + 7x2 + 5x3 -(y2+ -y2-) =75
        
Non Negatively constraints:

        xi >=0 ; i=1,2,3
